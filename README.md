# Mushroom Classification Project

This project aims to classify mushrooms as either "Edible" or "Poisonous" using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains various features related to the mushrooms' physical characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is called `mushroom_overload.csv`, which contains information on different mushroom species. Each entry includes attributes such as cap shape, cap color, and ring type, which are crucial for classification.

## Libraries Used

The following libraries were utilized in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Decision Tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, MLP Classifier, and Random Forest.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
2. **Data Visualization**: A bar chart is generated to display the count of edible and poisonous mushrooms.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Categorical features are encoded using `LabelEncoder` to convert them into a format suitable for machine learning models.
4. **Model Training**: Multiple classification models are trained on the dataset:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Ridge Classifier
   - Decision Tree
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes
   - MLP Classifier
   - Random Forest
5. **Model Evaluation**: Each model's performance is evaluated using the classification report, which includes metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results

The classification reports for each model are printed, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of their performance. The best-performing model can be chosen based on the evaluation metrics.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in classifying mushrooms based on their physical characteristics. The insights gained from this analysis can be useful in further research and practical applications in mycology.
